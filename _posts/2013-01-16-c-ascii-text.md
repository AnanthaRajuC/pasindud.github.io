One of our leatures allways told us to make the programs nice, Went looking for one didn't
find any c ascii text generators.

So I made a header file called ```asciitext.h```


[Github - https://github.com/pasindud/c_ascii_txt](https://github.com/pasindud/c_ascii_txt)
[testing](http://172.20.4.58:9090/smartoffice/interaction-cam)

###Usage
After including that you can use it like this.

```normaltext("pasindu")```

This is the result
