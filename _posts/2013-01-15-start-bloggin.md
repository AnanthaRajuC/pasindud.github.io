This has something from a previous post on blogging and my new thoughts

I been looking for a good blogging platform for a time now which is lightweight with all options need and hopefully without any database attached to.


####Choices 

-  	Wordpress
-	Ghost
- 	Blogspot
- 	Tumblr
- All other static site generators [https://www.staticgen.com/](https://www.staticgen.com/)

####Wordpress 

Hosting and maintaining it's easy but extremely capable


####[Jeklly](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
Is a static site generator , you have markdowns it will give you a full static site. Can have nifty plugins and templates to makes stuff easier.


####[Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/)
Ruhoh same as jekyll but exclusively for blogging which has a CLI to do some work for you. This is the project where I started learning ruby, I was able to put a fix for counting the no of posts in  that.
