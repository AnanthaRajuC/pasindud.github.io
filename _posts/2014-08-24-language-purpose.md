There are quite a few languages out there and many of them have there
speciality and purpose, let's note some ot them. Note that I have coded in all these languages in some point of time.


####Java
Platform independent program development


###C
Fast close to the computer


####Ruby
Fun to program (the dam thing is really nice to program)


####Python
Strict language to increase readability



####Erlang
Concurrence


####Node.js
Non blocking aka async


####PHP
Server-side scripting with quick development time


####JS
Client side scripting


####CSS
HTML styling 



Finally

C#

Incorporates everything from many languages isn't like your grandmother who knows everything 
just by looking at some TV programs.  C# IDE visual studio 12GB seriously 


Some "features" it has been having in other languages for many years.
These days visual studio has Node.js , python etc.

 

Advantage
If you have licences and run into a wall, call microsoft support. That's worth it right. ( This is the impression I got)


Who owns C# and develop PHP - microsoft bam ! they have an incentive to keep developing.


Who own and develop PHP - who the hell knows (only most websites is php and worlds biggest sites uses it)
doesn't have an incentive to develop the language.
