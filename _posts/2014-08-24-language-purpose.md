There are quite a few languages out there and many of them have there
speciality and purpose, let's note some to them. Note that I have coded in all these languages in some point of time.


####Java
Platform independent program development


###C
Fast close to the computer


####Ruby
Fun to program (the dam thing is really nice to program)


####Python
Strict language to increase readability



####Erlang
Concurrence


####Node.js
Non blocking aka async


####PHP
Server-side scripting with quick development time


####JS
Client side scripting


####CSS
HTML styling 



Finally

#### C Sharpe

Incorporates everything from many languages isn't like your grandmother who knows everything 
just by looking at some TV programs.  C# IDE visual studio 12GB seriously 


Some "features" it has been having in other languages for many years.
These days visual studio has Node.js , python etc.

I believe C# is best suited for desktop applications and not web applications
